Invited Reproducibility Papers
==============================

The Reproducibility Section of Information Systems publishes articles and experiments that make it possible for readers to reproduce the experimental results presented in Information Systems articles. A paper describing the reproducibility effort will be co-authored by the original authors and the reproducibility reviewer(s).

1.   Conducting a Review

The same obligations regarding ethics, conflict of interest, and confidentially apply for the Reproducibility Section. The deliberations are strictly confidential, including the paper, software and data under review.

Authors will be providing the software, together with the data and scripts that are responsible for the results presented in their paper. In addition, they will submit a description of the details of the software and all the required instructions to configure, run, and reproduce the results.

2.   Review Process

The review process lasts around 60 days and it is not blind. Authors are encouraged to engage in a discussion with reviewers about the extent to which the claims presented in the paper can be confirmed, and to which the provided software allows others to benefit from it.

2.1. Initial Inspection

Reviewers should do a quick initial inspection to verify that the submitted software and paper meet the required standards, and to detect show-stopping problems. Based on this review, authors should be allowed to correct any errors and provide any missing information on their software, if this can be done quickly.

Reviewers are expected to verify that:

- They have the required platform and computational environment to run the assigned experiment: if not, this must be immediately communicated to the editor;
- The software is portable to a wide variety of platforms including platforms available to the reviewer;
- Authors provided enough information and explanation about the software and its configuration in the reproducibility paper;
- There is any missing code, data, or script;
- The software can be compiled, installed, and run with no errors or major issues.

In case there is something missing, reviewers should ask for a revision, describing in detail the computational environment to be used for their evaluation, any errors or issues they found, and any missing piece of information authors must provide.

2.2. Core Evaluation

Reviewers are expected to verify:

- If the reproducibility paper is well-written and complete;
- If the results presented in the paper, including plots and tables, can be reproduced;
- If the claims written in the paper can be confirmed in the experiments (e.g.: if the paper claims that the software is a high-performance library, can this be verified in the experiments?);
- If the results are robust to changes in the experiment configuration, if applicable (e.g.: changes in parameters and minor changes to data);
- If the software is usable enough to allow others to benefit from it, by using that software as a subcomponent of a new system.

Reviewers are not expected to review the original Information Systems article, as it will have been accepted for publication.

Reviewers will grade the software to either accept or reject it, or ask for revision. After all reviews are in, they will try to reach a consensus on the overall grade of the software and reproducibility paper. In case a consensus cannot be reached, the editor will break ties.

3.   After Acceptance

The editor will incorporate a summary of the review discussion into the reproducibility paper, and the reviewers will become co-authors of the reproducibility paper. Reviewers are also welcome (and highly encouraged!) to add a section that states the extent to which the software is portable, is robust to changes, and is likely to be usable as a subcomponent or as a basis for comparison by future researchers.
