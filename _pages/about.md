Currently, I'm a Ph.D. candidate at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, under the supervision of [Prof. Juliana Freire](http://vgc.poly.edu/~juliana/). I came to the beautiful - and very busy - city of New York in January 2012. Before, I worked as a Research Assistant at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), under the supervision of [Prof. Marta Mattoso](http://www.cos.ufrj.br/~marta/). I have a B.E. from UFRJ, in Computer and Information Engineering. To check my full CV, click [here](/files/resume.pdf).

I come from the gorgeous city of [Petr&oacute;polis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr%C3%B3polis), in Brazil, where almost all my family and friends still reside. I had the opportunity to study in [Rio de Janeiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro), the "Marvelous City", where I not only made a lot of good friends, but also started working with research in the database area.

Research
------

My research interests are mainly in the area of scientific data management, including **provenance management and analytics**, **large-scale data analytics**, **data mining**, **reproducibility**, and **data visualization**.

Some of the projects on which I'm currently working are:

* **Urban Data Management and Analytics**: Understanding the urban environment by efficiently analyzing the numerous interactions among large spatio-temporal urban data (e.g.: [Data Polygamy](https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/data-polygamy)).
* **[Reproducibility in Science](http://www.reproduciblescience.org/)**: Infrastructure to facilitate the creation, reuse, and sharing of reproducible computational experiments (e.g.: [ReproZip](https://www.reprozip.org/), [noWorkflow](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow)).

I am also Reproducibility Editor for the [Information Systems Journal, Elsevier North-Holland](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems/).
                
Please refer to my list of [publications](/publications/) and [professional activities](/professional/) for more details.
