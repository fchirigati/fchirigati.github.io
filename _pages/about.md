Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Tandon School of Engineering</a> and <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Center for Data Science</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://vgc.poly.edu/~juliana/" target="_blank">Prof. Juliana Freire</a>. I came to the beautiful - and very busy - city of New York in January 2012 to pursue a Ph.D. degree. Before, I worked as a Research Assistant at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cos.ufrj.br/~marta/" target="_blank">Prof. Marta Mattoso</a>. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from NYU, and a B.E. in Computer and Information Engineering from UFRJ. To check out my full CV, click <a href="/files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I come from the gorgeous city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr%C3%B3polis" target="_blank">Petr&oacute;polis</a>, in Brazil, where almost all my family and friends still reside. I had the opportunity to study in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" target="_blank">Rio de Janeiro</a>, the "Marvelous City", where I not only made a lot of good friends, but also started working with research in the database area.

Research
------

My research interests are mainly in the area of scientific data management, including **provenance management and analytics**, **large-scale data analytics**, **data mining**, **reproducibility**, and **data visualization**.

Some of the projects on which I'm currently working are:

* **Streamlining Model Design, Comparison, and Curation**: Developing automated model discovery systems that
enable users with subject matter expertise but no data science background to create empirical models of real, complex processes.
* **Urban Data Management and Analytics**: Understanding the urban environment by efficiently analyzing the numerous interactions among large spatio-temporal urban data (e.g.: <a href="https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/data-polygamy" target="_blank">Data Polygamy</a>).
* **<a href="http://www.reproduciblescience.org/" target="_blank">Reproducibility in Science</a>**: Infrastructure to facilitate the creation, reuse, and sharing of reproducible computational experiments (e.g.: <a href="https://www.reprozip.org/" target="_blank">ReproZip</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow" target="_blank">noWorkflow</a>).
* **Saving Data Journalism**: Developing a prototype to enable systematic collection and preservation of dynamic news websites.

I am also Reproducibility Editor for the <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems/" target="_blank">Information Systems Journal, Elsevier North-Holland</a>.
